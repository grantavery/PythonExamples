# Local Variables:
# When you declare variables inside a function definition,
# they are not related in any way to other variables with the
# same names used outside the function -
# i.e. variable names are local to the function.
# This is called the scope of the variable.
# All variables have the scope of the block they are declared
# in starting from the point of definition of the name.

# Code in the global scope cannot use any local variables.
# However, a local scope can access global variables.
# Code in a functionâ€™s local scope cannot use variables in any other local scope.
# You can use the same name for different variables if they are in different scopes. That is, there can be a local variable named spam and a global variable also named spam.

# Why? memory constraints
# While using global variables in small programs is fine, it is a bad habit to rely on global variables as your programs get larger and larger.

# If you need to modify a global variable from within a function, use the global statement
